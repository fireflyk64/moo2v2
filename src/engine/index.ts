// Engine: the pure, deterministic game core.
//
// Layer rules (enforced by scripts/check-boundaries.mjs):
// - No imports from outside src/engine (zero runtime dependencies).
// - No sources of nondeterminism; randomness comes only from the seeded PRNG.

export const ENGINE_VERSION = '0.8.0'; // 2026-07-10 audit fixes: validator purity + payload hardening, classId-5 weapons fire, per-colony growth/starvation, CP/freighter/gravity/farming corrections, connectivity-safe monster seeding, planet specials, outpost razing, eliminated-empire scrub
